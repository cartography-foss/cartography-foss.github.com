## 2. Course programme

**Preliminary notes:**  Durations of sessions are provided solely for information purposes and are subject to changes based on participants specific needs, expectations and existing capacities. The same holds true for course sequence.


### Basics (1 h)
* Colours model and encoding (RGB vs HSV and Hexadecimal numeral system)
* Data types (what is a “real”, “integer”, “string”)
* HTML and CSS (concept and basics)

### Fundamentals (2 h)
* Geographical Information System (GIS) Data Model (Raster vs Vector)
* Spatial Reference System and Map projections
* Semiology of Graphics
* Shapefiles (de facto geospatial vector data standard)
* Data sources

### QGIS (10 h)
* Introduction and basics (user interface, navigation, features selection, map vs attribute view, styling, saving projects, …)
* Importing georeferenced data (ex : field measurements)
* Plugins system (extension modules installation and management)
* Managing Spatial Reference System and Map projections
* Georeferencing scanned topographic map or satellite imagery
* Digitizing
* GRASS plugin (interpolation, creating distance maps, spatial analysis, …)
* GDAL toolkits (Advanced-optional)
* Importing/Exporting KML files

### TileMill (15 h)
* TileMill introduction (presentation, user interface, concept)
* Loading shapefiles and raster data
* “Carto” styling language (symbolizers –markers, polygons, points, text, raster, …)
* Examples: styling Cesium137 measurement dataset, landuse, raster files…
* Legend and interactivity balloons creation
* Exporting interactive visualization online through MapBox

### GoogleEarth (10 h)
* Introduction and basics (user interface, navigation, visualizing elevation profiles, creating features, …)
* KML (understanding the fundamental XML-based data format)
* Ground overlay (overlay of raster data –satellite imagery, interpolation, distance maps, … onto GoogleEarth virtual globe)
* Create time animation in order to visualize time series
* Understanding GoogleEarth balloons (for better interactivity and embedding rich content as text, images and videos)
* Creating tours (as an efficient tool to tell stories)
* Creating KML file with Python (Advanced-optional)

### Introduction to Decision Support System (2 h)
* Presentation of lightweight collaborative data portal architectures based on a stack of open source technologies such as GitHub, MapBox.js, Prose.io,
* Setup of a demonstration data portal dedicated to the visualization of georeferenced data produced during the course (optional)
